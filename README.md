# Cybersecurity Home Lab (SOC Analyst Beginner Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents the step-by-step creation of a Cybersecurity Home Lab designed to simulate real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst tasks.

### The lab is built using VirtualBox with:
- Kali Linux (analysis / attacker / SOC tools)
- Windows 10 (log source / victim machine)

### The goal is to gain hands-on experience in:
- Endpoint monitoring
- Log analysis
- PowerShell logging
- SOC-style investigations

This repository documents everything from initial setup to future attack simulations.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Kali Linux (Pre-built VM)
- Windows 10 (ISO – non-activated)
- Wireshark
- Sysinternals Suite
- Windows Event Viewer
- PowerShell Logging

### Host System Constraints

- CPU: 1.8 GHz
- Strategy: Run one VM at a time for stability

### Lab Architecture (Current)
- Host Machine
- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux VM
- Windows-SOC-Lab VM

### Documentation Approach
- Daily progress is documented
- Configuration decisions are explained
- Screenshots will be added in future commits

## Current Status

✅ Kali Linux configured 
✅ Windows VM installed and hardened 
✅ SOC-level logging enabled

## Next Planned Steps
- Configure VM networking (Host-only + NAT)
- Install Wireshark analysis scenarios
- Install Splunk (future – resource dependent)
- Simulate SOC incidents (brute force, suspicious PowerShell)

## Learning Outcome
- This project demonstrates:
- Virtualization skills
- Endpoint monitoring fundamentals
- SOC analyst mindset
- Hands-on cybersecurity practice

## Disclaimer
This lab is for educational purposes only. No real systems or networks are targeted.


#### This repository will continue to evolve as more SOC scenarios are implemented.
